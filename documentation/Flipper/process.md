I used the unleashed firmware within about ten minutes of unboxing this thing.

***It's also forked on my page
The main purpose of this isn't, for me, a pentesting device, but a comms means with other microcomputing projects.
Flipper Zero has a litany of user friendly NFC and radio elements to it, which are amazing for testing communicative builds.

So after flashing the unleashed firmware, I realized I needed a ton of signals. 
Turns out all of the "exploits" for flipper are just open source signals from prior captures.... easy peazy.
