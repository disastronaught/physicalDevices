This is a neat one. It's back in the realm of physical security and signal analysis. 
After seeing the flipper pop up everywhere and thinking "I should build one of those from the ground up"
I decided to get a lower level dev kit where you could see and interact with the hardware a little more.
Also the different ranges allow for more customized bands in the capture range.

I bought a Proxmark3Easy which at the time was a nicely discounted $41 on Amazon. This is the "512" model
so it's compatible with Iceman's code written specifically for Proxmark devices.
For the startup and trial uses, I'm borrowing methodology from DangerousThings.com
He does an excellent unboxing and full startup tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6WOTM4D970
Also if you're a text based learner (like me) he has a 10 page or so writeup here: https://dngr.us/pm3-guide
