Starting out with a Raspberry Pi Zero W and a Uniker MZP351HV00BR 2.8inch touchscreen, a soldering iron, solder, flux pen, and 512GB microSD

I wetted the pins on the screen to ensure proper flow out of solder, set the gun to 860F and while it heated, mounted the two components 
together with the heat sink from the CPU facing me, and the memory card slot closest to the dampener on the touchscreen.

For these GPIO solder jobs, I like to use a narrow chisel tip with no angular properties. This allows me to stand the iron up perpendicular
from the boart and make sidelong contact with the GPIO pin while the tip rests on the trace ring. This partially avoids heating other pins
while attempting to solder something next door. Pressing too firmly while soldering can really damage components and traces, but no one 
ever tells you just how much pressure to place. Ideally, you'd let the weight of the tool do the job. This may increase by a few grams from
the pressure it takes to hold the iron upright.

Once the soldering is complete, I flashed a micro SD with the available raspios(formerly Raspbian) to insert before I started up.
I did use the micro-HDMI to set up the OS before I switched over the screen selection to GPIO. I had a little fish-finder screen that 
took a 9VDC power supply and HDMI input. the following CMDlets were run in the terminal to configure the TFT's drivers and setup:

For the final setup for the touchscreen, I searched the internet for previous builds who had used this screed and pi, they all pointed to 
https://github.com/tianoujian. This guy wrote up some excellent boot scripts and made major contributions to the functionality of my
current build. There's even custom directories for the precise models of screen. I ran these commands in the pi terminal

#MZP351HV00BR
>cd MZDPI/mzp351hv00br
>sudo chmod +x ./mzdpi-hvga-autoinstall
>sudo ./mzdpi-hvga-autoinstall
>sudo reboot

After running these the board reboots and the touchscreen is fully functional.
