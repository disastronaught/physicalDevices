This is the finalization build for the Raspberry Pi Zero W I soldered to a 2.8" touchscreen
Originally I used RaspiOS but I plan on loading the retro gaming emulation OS to it.
Currently the deck case is printing on the Ender3. 
Here's where I got the boilerplate design for the case: https://www.printables.com/model/369948-cyberdore-rpi-powered-cyberdeck
I'll likely edit a second model and put some angle in it between the screen mount and keyboard.
