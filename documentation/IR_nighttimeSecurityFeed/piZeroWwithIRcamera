TLDR: Create a live feed night vision setup on Raspberry Pi Zero with 2.8"TFT and $21 IR camera.
raspivid -hf -vf -fps 30 -o - -t 0 | cvlc -vvv stream:///dev/stdin --sout '#rtp{sdp=rtsp://:8554/}' :demux=h264
(run it twice)



//the following are command strings I ran on the rapios loaded pi zero w with Uniker 2.8inch TFT touchscreen enabled
>raspivid -hf -vf -fps 30 -o - | mplayer -fps 30 -cache 1024 -
//ok so that last one sent the feed to the TFT screen, but it dies after around 3 seconds which means there's
//a problem with the color space conversion when piping the video stream from raspivid to mplayer. Now I have to specify the pixel
//format for the output of raspivid and adjust the commands I present to the mplayer service.
>raspivid -hf -vf -fps 30 -o - -pix_fmt yuv420p | mplayer -fps 30 -cache 1024 -demuxer rawvideo -rawvideo w=1920:h=1080:format=I420 -
//that doesn't work either... let's try to use simplified commands because raw video format is breaking the streaming capability of the pi
>raspivid -hf -vf -fps 30 -o - -t 0 | mplayer -fps 30 -cache 1024 -demuxer h264es -
//normally that last one would run a live feed, but it crashes in still frame mode and prints the mplayer man pages
//I'm gonna try running omxplayer and see if it works smoother with raspberry pi hardware.
>sudo apt-get update
>sudo apt-get install omxplayer
//well that package is obsolete... let's go add the raspberrypi.org repository and get it running
sudo echo "deb http://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian/ buster main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 82B129927FA3303E
//then we can do a little update and reinstall
>sudo apt-get update
>sudo apt-get install omxplayer
>raspivid -hf -vf -fps 30 -o - -t 0 | omxplayer --live -
//ooooo a permissions error (haven't seen one of those in a while). Let's use an outdated keygen server to rerun that successfully
>sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 82B129927FA3303E
//then we update again to save the repository upgrade
>sudo apt-get update
//and that didn't work either.. 
//fine fine raspberry pi. I'll go back and do what I should've done from the beginning and just run VLC
(it's already installed on the piOS)
raspivid -hf -vf -fps 30 -o - -t 0 | cvlc -vvv stream:///dev/stdin --sout '#rtp{sdp=rtsp://:8554/}' :demux=h264
//I had to run that last one twice to delete and reformat the media libraries and the stream runs until I hit Ctl+C on the keypad.
