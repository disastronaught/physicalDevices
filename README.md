# physicalDevices
Successes and more than enough failures. Here's where I'll post pictures and code examples of microcomputers and physical alterations to devices I build/rebuild.

All code and practices here are posted to the public domain. Feel free to copy, replicate, alter, or reuse any of what you see here. 
I'm not responsible for your actions. If you upload a script to your device or machine and it turns into a paperweight, you are responsible.
